/**
 * This Stimulus controller, `AutoSubmitController`, automatically submits a form
 * using the designated submit button, with options for immediate or delayed submission.
 * Itâ€™s typically used for cases where forms should auto-submit on certain events,
 * such as typing or changing fields.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Add `data-controller="auto-submit"` to the form or form container element.
 * - Add `data-auto-submit-target="submit"` to the submit button used for submission.
 *
 * Targets:
 * - `submit`: the submit button element that will be triggered for form submission.
 *
 * Values:
 * - `delay`: the delay in ms before the form is sent with the `delayed` method, default: 500 ms.
